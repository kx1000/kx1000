### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ˜Š Hi there! I'm a backend developer with a passion for creating simple solutions to complex problems. I have extensive experience designing and implementing RESTful APIs using Symfony.

Over the years, I've honed my skills in database design, performance optimization, and testing. I'm also comfortable working with other backend technologies, such as Node.js.

In my spare time, I enjoy experimenting with new technologies.
